If you do not wish, or feel that you cannot tell one of your parents
about your pregnancy, or your desire to terminate the pregnancy, you
have the right to talk to a judge about getting a court order that
allows you to make your own decision.  The judge will have to determine
that; you are mature enough to make this decision, or that you are or
have been a victim of child abuse or sexual abuse by a parent or
guardian or that it would not be in your best interest to tell your
parents.

- The court process is free and confidential.
- You have the right to legal representation.
- The court must schedule the hearing within 48 hours.
- You have a right to appeal the court's decision.
