Tubal Ligation
==============

Is a permanent method of pregnancy prevention.  A woman’s fallopian
tubes are tied which prevents the egg from being released into the
uterus from the fallopian tube.  Tubal ligation involves surgery and all
the risks associated with anesthesia, infection and wound healing.

Medical experts estimate that about 20% of all women undergoing tubal
ligation regret the decision and request that it be reversed.  There are
a number of reasons why a woman might change her mind.  Included might
be the death of a partner, divorce, death of a child, or other reason.

While tubal ligation may be reversible, it is complicated, expensive and
has a relatively low rate of success.  Therefore it is important to
carefully consider this method of permanent birth control.  Many doctors
are reluctant to provide this surgery for young women because tubal
ligation is meant to be permanent.

Advantages of Tubal Ligation
----------------------------

- Permanent Birth Control.
- Can Protect the life of the woman where pregnancy may be life
  threatening due to existing medical conditions.
- May increase comfort level and spontaneity of a woman’s sexual
  response once she is no longer concerned about becoming pregnant.

Disadvantages of Tubal Ligation
-------------------------------

- Tubal ligation does not protect a woman against the transmission of
  STDs.
- Involves risks related to surgery.
- Is costly to reverse.
- Only 60-80% of reversals result in conception.
- There is an increased risk of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy after a tubal
  ligation for women who do become pregnant after the surgery.
- There is a small increase risk of abnormal bleeding and bladder
  infection.
- Post Tubal Syndrome may include irregular periods, painful periods, or
  bleeding mid-cycle.  More research needs to be done regarding this
  syndrome as there is some debate among experts about these issues.
