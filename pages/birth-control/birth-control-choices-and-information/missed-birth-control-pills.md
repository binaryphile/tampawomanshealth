If you miss one (1) pill

: Take it as soon as you remember, then take your pills as scheduled at
the same time every day.

: No additional contraception such as the morning after pill or condoms
should be necessary if you have missed only one pill.

If you miss two (2) pills

: Take both missed pills at the same time on the day you realize you
have missed two pills, then continue taking your birth control pills as
scheduled.

: In addition to taking the missed pills, you should **not** have
intercourse, or you should use a secondary method of birth control for
one week.

: Your birth control pills are not effective until you have had seven
consecutive doses in a row.

Inconsistent or incorrect use of birth control pills is the major reason
women report becoming pregnant by accident.

Take the pill seven days in a row is necessary to prevent ovulation.

Women who miss pills often or have a difficult time staying on a strict
schedule with their birth control pills should consider a different
method of birth control.
