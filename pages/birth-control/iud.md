The IUD is a small t-shaped device that is inserted into the vagina to
prevent unwanted pregnancy.

In the United States, there are two types of IUDs available. The Mirena,
which continuously releases hormones for up to five years, and the
Para-Grad which has no hormones but contains copper can be left in for
10 years.

They have become very popular due to the 99% effective rate, and the
relatively low cost compared to oral contraceptives.

IUDs are effective as soon as they are inserted. Women still ovulate but
the IUD will prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg.

Both types of IUDs work by preventing an egg from becoming fertilized.
The IUD has a long history of being well tolerated by most women. While
doctors used to be reluctant to recommend an IUD for a young woman, or a
woman who has never given birth, experience has shown that the risks and
benefits are the same for most women whether or not they have had a
prior pregnancy.

IUDs present some risks for women who are HIV positive, have a severely
tilted uterus, women that are severely anemic, women with increased
risks of STDs, and women with pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).

Many women report that their periods are shorter and lighter while on
the IUD. Especially the one that releases hormones. The Para-Gard is
sometimes associated with a slightly heavier period until your body
adjusts. Once the IUD is put in place by your doctor you will be able to
feel only two very small thread like strings in the vagina. These do not
cause discomfort during intercourse and are rarely reported as being
detected by a womenâ€™s partner.

There are a few very real possible risks with IUDs:

- Uterine perforation, a very rare complication during the insertion of
  the IUD.
- Uterine Infection, caused by pre-existing bacteria in the vagina. Can
  usually be solved with antibiotics.
- Increased risk if PID (Pelvic inflammatory Disease)
- Increased risk of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage if a woman becomes
  pregnant with an IUD present.

Pregnancy After The IUD
-----------------------

The IUD is a reversible form of birth control. This means that it
prevents pregnancy while it is in the uterus, but a woman is able to get
pregnant once it is removed with very rare exceptions.
