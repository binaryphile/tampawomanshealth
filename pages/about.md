We are committed to the quality of care you deserve, and the right to
have that care available to you.  We support every woman's right to full
control of her reproductive options.

Tampa Woman's Health Center is strongly committed to providing safe,
confidential, non-judgemental care for every patient.  It is our
philosophy that every patient's right to choose be respected.  To that
end, our patient Advocate meets with each patient to assure that our
patients have all the information they need.  We believe that each
patient is entitled to honesty.  We are happy to answer any questions
about the abortion procedure, medical protocols, after care, our
licenses, policies, staff and facility.

We work with each patient to assure that the patient has a comfortable,
safe and medically appropriate experience.  This includes providing
emotional support and tender, compassionate care throughout the process.

You have a right to privacy.  Our staff will not release information
about your procedure or even confirm that you are our patient without
your consent.  We realize that this can create some problems when you
have asked someone to call on your behalf.  However, to assure your
privacy, we will need to speak only to you about your care, or you can
sign a Written Release of Information so that we can indeed communicate
with your loved one, your physician or someone else of your choosing.
