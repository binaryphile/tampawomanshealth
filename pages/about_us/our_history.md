title: Our History
---

G. Michael Nauert, MD founded the Woman's Health Centers in 1975.  He
developed his passion for serving women as a result of his early
experience as an intern in the emergency rooms, at one of the area's
major hospitals.  Dr. Nuaert witnessed women in the ER hemorrhaging,
with severe, life threatening infections (sepsis) and some fatalities as
a result of illegal abortions.  Dr.  Nauert devoted his career to
providing quality care to women who choose to have an abortion.

We lost a friend, mentor, colleague, father and husband on April 26,
2007.  However, the three clinics continue Dr. Nauert's drive and
dedication to provide medically sound, low-cost reproductive health care
in a supportive atmosphere.  Tampa Woman's Health Center, Bread & Roses
and St. Petersburg Woman's Health Center are recognized by the National
Abortion Federation (N.A.F.) as providing over 30 years of excellence in
healthcare.

Tampa Woman's Health Center is a licensed care facility.  All abortions
are performed by qualified, licensed gynecologists with specialized
training in the area of abortion medicine.

Our professional staff includes OB/GYN doctors, Advanced Registered
Nurse Practitioners, trained Peer Counselors, Sonogram Technicians,
CNAs, MAs and Patient Care Technicians.

Patients can depend on the finest medical care, as well as ethical
conduct by all staff members.
