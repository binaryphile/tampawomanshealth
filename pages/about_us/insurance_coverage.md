We accept and verify insurance.

We are in-network providers for many health insurance companies, and are
out of network for several others.  We will be happy to accept and
verify your benefit coverage for you.  Please provide us with the
appropriate insurance information when you make your appointment so that
we can assist you.

Some policies do not cover elective abortion, but may cover your other
reproductive and well woman care.  If your policy does not cover
termination of pregnancy, you will need to pay in full for the services
provided.  You may still provide us with your insurance information and
we will gladly file the claim.  If your insurance pays for some of the
related expenses, you may be reimbursed up to the amount you prepaid.
This process may take up to 60 days.

We ask each patient to bring their insurance card with them to their
appointment so that we can help with filing your claim.
