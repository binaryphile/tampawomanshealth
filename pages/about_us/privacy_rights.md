You have a right to privacy.  Our staff will not release information
about you, your procedure or even confirm that you are our patient
without your consent.  We realize that this can create some problems
when you have asked someone to call in your behalf.

However, to assure your privacy, we will need to speak only to you about
your care, or you can sign a Written Release of Information so that we
can indeed communicate with your loved one, your physician or someone
else of your choosing.
