As many as 75% of sexually active adults will contract genital human
papillomavirus (HPV) at some point in their lives, yet many are unaware
of what HPV is and how this sexually transmitted disease is spread.  Are
you one of them?  Read on for a better understanding of HPV and its
transmission.

Fast Facts:  What is HPV?
-------------------------

- HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
  About 20 million people are infected with HPV in the United States,
  with 5.5 million new infections every year.
- HPV is one of the most common viral STDs among college students, and
  it seems to be prevalent in women in their 20s.
- More than 100 types of HPV have been identified, most of which are
  harmless.
- Thirty types are spread through sexual contact and affect the genital
  area.  Of these 30 types, some cause genital warts while others cause
  subclinical infections that are invisible, with no obvious signs and
  symptoms.  One prominent study reported that almost half of women
  infected with HPV had no noticeable symptoms. 
- Genital warts are common and can be treated.

The Most Noticable Symptom
--------------------------

Genital warts are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV
infection.  Two-thirds of people who have sexual contact through either
oral, genital or anal sex with an infected partner will develop warts.
However, many people have a genital HPV infection without genital warts.
(HPV can also cause skin warts on the hands and soles of their feet).

Warts may develop outside and inside the vagina, on the cervix or around
the anus.  In men, genital warts are less common.  When they do occur,
they surface on the tip and shaft of the penis, on the scrotum or around
the anus.

Genital warts often occur in clusters and can be very tiny or can spread
into larger masses in the genital or anal area.  Your NP can diagnose
genital warts by sight, and women with genital warts should be examined
for possible HPV infection of the cervix.  Also, an abnormal Pap smear
result could indicate an HPV infection.

Treating HPV
------------

Genital warts often disappear without treatment, but some eventually may
develop a fleshy, small, raised growth resembling cauliflower.  Whether
warts grow or disappear is entirely unpredictable.  So, if you suspect
you have genital warts, you should be examined and treated if necessary.

Treatment depends on the size and location of the warts.  Your NP will
decide which of the following treatments is best:

- Imiquimod (Aldara)
- Podophyllin (Podocon-25)
- Podofilox (Condylox)
- Fluorouracil (Fluoroplex, Efudex)
- Trichloroacetic acid
- Cryosurgery (freezing), electrocautery (burning) or laster treatment
  may be used if the warts are small.
- Alpha interferon can be injected directly into warts that have
  returned after being removed by traditional means, but it is expensive
  and does not reduce the chance of recurring warts.
- Surgical excision may be performed to remove large warts that have not
  responded to any other treatment.

Although treatments can get rid of the warts, none can get rid of the
virus that causes them.  Because the virus is still present in your
body, warts often come back after treatment.

Preventing HPV
--------------

The only sure way to prevent an HPV infection is to avoid direct contact
with the virus.  If you or your sexual partner has visible warts in the
genital area, avoid any sexual contact, until the warts are treated.
Condoms do not prevent HPV transmission.

Complications 
-------------

Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer.  Others are associated with
vulvar and anal cancer and cancer of the penis, which is rare.  Most HPV
infections do not progress to cervical cancer.
