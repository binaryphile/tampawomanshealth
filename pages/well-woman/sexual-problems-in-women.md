Sexual problems are not uncommon.  It may mean that sex is not
pleasurable, that there is a problem getting aroused, or difficulty
achieving an orgasm.  Sometimes, woman experience pain with intercourse.
Symptoms are only a problem if they bother you or cause a problem in
your relationship.

There really is no "normal" response.  It is different for everyone.
Sometimes we experience a problem that resolves itself.  It was
temporary.  Often sex drive is tied to hormones and hormones change.
Sexuality is complex.  If there is a problem in either the physical or
emotional part of your life, you may experience sexual problems.  One
third of all women report a lack of interest in sex at some point in
their life.  Nearly half of all women report a problem getting aroused
or reaching orgasm some of the time.  20% of women report that sex is
not always comfortable and one third of women report a total lack of
interest in sex during some point on their lives.

It is helpful to know that we are not the "only one" that has ever
experienced these feelings.  Just as our bodies change, our hormones
change, our lives are complex, and it all affects how we sometimes feel
about sex.

Understanding the Cause of Sexual Problems
------------------------------------------

Some common causes are:

- Emotional stress, relationship problems, depression, anxiety, past
  sexual trauma or unhappiness with your body image.
- Physical causes such as problem with hormones, arthritis or diabetes,
  pain on intercourse, dryness in the vagina, use of some medications
  that affect desire or response.

When a woman feels she is experiencing some sexual problems, you may
want to ask yourself some questions:

- Are you ill or taking medicine for a certain medical condition?
- Are you very stressed or overtired?
- Do you and your partner have time and privacy to be together?
- Is your partner respectful and loving?
- Do you have issues of a sexual nature that have bothered you before?

Treatment for sexual problems depends on what is causing the problem.  A
frank discussion with your doctor or nurse practitioner may help.  There
may be more than one issue.  If you feel that it would be difficult to
discuss this issue with your doctor, perhaps you can write out a list of
symptoms and information you would like to share, and then use that list
at your appointment.
