title: Instructions for After Your Abortion
avatar: female-nurse-calling
---

Pregnancy termination as performed at {{data.name}} is a relatively
simple procedure.  However, like other surgical operations,
complications can occur through no fault of the doctor or medical
attendants.  Although these complications do not happen often, it is
important that you know what to expect and what to do just in case one
of these situations occur.

Fever

: **Take your temperature with a thermometer each afternoon and evening
for the next five days.  If it is 100 degrees or higher, **call your
Health Center promptly.**  A fever may mean that you are getting an
infection and it is URGENT that you report it at once so you can be
treated.  Infection is the most frequent complication after an abortion.
About 1 patient in every 100 patients experiences some degree of
infection.  In most cases, the infection is noticed within three days
after the surgery and it can usually be treated simply and effectively
with antibiotics.

Bleeding

: Excessive bleeding is a less frequent complication.  The normal amount
of bleeding is different for each woman.  Some women may have very
little bleeding or no bleeding at all for several days and suddenly,
they can experience an increase after day 5 to 6.  Many women will have
heavier bleeding, much like a period, which may last 3-5 days after the
surgery.  Some woman spot bleed for 2-4 weeks.  Some do not bleed at
all.  You may pass large or small clots and bleeding may seem to
increase when you get up suddenly or go to the toilet.  The flow may
also increase after you have stopped taking the methergine pills.  **If
the amount of bleeding increases to the point that you are soaking more
than one pad per hour, call TWHC promptly.  Note:  Your first period
will occur in 4-12 weeks.**

Cramping

: Cramping is usually caused by the uterus contracting to control
bleeding.  Do not be concerned if you experience mild cramping for
several days.  Cramping may be felt in the lower abdomen, back, inner
thighs or legs.  You should be able to get relief by taking 800mg of
Ibuprofen, a non-aspirin medicine, or by using a heating pad or hot
water bottle.  You have been given a prescription for pain medication.
Have it filled at your pharmacy and take it as directed, if needed, for
cramping.  Alternate your pain medication with 3 doses per day of 800mg
ibuprofen.  **If the cramping is severe or constant, and you are not
able to get relief from any of these methods, call TWHC immediately.**

Swelling

: You may notice some abdominal swelling or bloating following your
procedure.  Some swelling is normal and may last for 3 to 5 days.  **If
the swelling is accompanied by tenderness, fever, chills, severe
cramping or excessive bleeding, it is not normal and you should call
TWHC immediately.**

Problems

: **Call immediately if you have any problems (fever, excessive bleeding
or cramping), which may indicate complications.**  A member of the WHC
staff is available for emergency calls during the hours when the center
is not open.  Answering services are in great demand and sometimes very
busy.  Sometimes it is necessary to let the phone ring several times.
If the phone is not answered, hang up and call the number again.  **If
you need information and it is NOT an emergency, please call the center
directly between the hours of 8:00am and 5:00pm, Monday through
Friday.**

What to Know When You Call

: - Your temperature within the last hour.
- The number of sanitary pads that you have soaked within the last 3
  hours.
- The telephone number of your pharmacy.

: If you are having problems, it is best to contact the center early in
the day when pharmacies in your area are still open.  **For all
emergencies related to your abortion, call the center or the emergency
number on this information sheet.**  Do not go to the emergency room of
a hospital.  This would only result in additional cost to you and is
**almost always unnecessary**.

: Because of the long history if frequent, serious complications related
to unskilled, illegal abortions, some physicians in the past have felt
that women should be hospitalized for heavy bleeding, cramping or fever.
**Current medical experience suggests that most complications can be
treated effectively with medication**, without requiring a hospital
visit.  If hospitalization is necessary, we will be glad to fully inform
your physician about the your abortion procedure.

To Prevent Infection

: After your surgery, you can reduce the risk of getting an infection by
making a few temporary changes to your lifestyle.  In 3-4 weeks, you
will return to the clinic for your post-abortion checkup.  At that time,
you should be able to return to all of your normal activities.

Keep in mind, the more active you are for the first 5-7 days following
your abortion, the more bleeding and cramping you may experience.

Medication Information

: You may have been given an antibiotic to prevent infection and/or
methergine to contract your uterus.  If so, begin taking both of them
today.  Follow the directions given on the prescription bottles.  Take
all your medicines with food.

Your Feelings

: During pregnancy, a woman's body goes through a hormonal change which
may cause moodiness. After a pregnancy is ended, either by childbirth or
abortion, the body again goes through some changes.  You may have some
depression or a "blue day" or two during the week following the
abortion.  If you are troubled by negative thoughts or feelings about
the abortion a month or two afterwards, please return to the center and
let us give you a referral to a qualified mental health counselor.
Abortion does not cause mental health issues.

Post Abortion Check-up

: To be sure that your body is back to normal after your abortion, you
are required to return for a post abortion examination.  If you do not
keep your appointment, your health and well being may be in danger.  The
center, its staff, and the attending physician(s) cannot be held
responsible for your care after your abortion if you do not show up for
this scheduled appointment.  This WARNING is for your own benefit.
Please take care of yourself by keeping this important post abortion
checkup appointment.  **This check-up is a free service provided by the
center.**
