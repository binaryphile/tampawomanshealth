The two medical procedures include the RU486 pill and the Methotrexate
shot.  The fee for the chemical procedures includes the same as the
surgical procedure excluding the I.V. sedation and a local block (not
given for chemical procedures).  The fee includes either the RU486 pill
or a shot of Methotrexate to stop the growth of the pregnancy; the
Misoprostal pills to help dilate and expel the pregnancy; and three to
five office visits that include sonograms.  There may be an additional
charge for Quantitative Betas.

If the abortion is not performed, the fee will be refunded except for
the cost of the Sonogram and any applicable lab fees.

We highly recommend you ask other clinics what their fees include.  Many
of our competitors apply additional fees for IV sedation, medications,
testing and follow-up exams.

The centers have a "no billing" policy.  All fees are payable at the
time of the procedure.Acceptable forms of payment include cash, Visa,
MasterCard, traveler's checks, and money orders.

- Due to the amount of returned unpaid checks, NO personal checks can be
  accepted.
- An additional charge is made for Anti-Rh serum for the Rh Negative
  woman.
