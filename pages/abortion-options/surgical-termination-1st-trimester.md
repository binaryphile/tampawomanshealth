The third option we offer is the suction curettage abortion.  We provide
surgical abortions throughout the 1st trimaster of pregnancy, 4.5 - 13.6
weeks gestation.  It is performed by an OB/GYN medical doctor while the
patient is under local anesthesia in the vein and a cervical block.  The
actual abortion procedure takes approximately five to seven minutes.
However, plan to be at the clinic approximately 3 to 4 hours.  We spend
the first hour reviewing your medical history, providing necessary
information, and taking the required lab work and an ultrasound
(sonogram).  You will meet with doctor prior to your procedure and then
be given the sedation.  Following the procedure, you will spend 30-45
minutes in the Recovery Room before being discharged.
