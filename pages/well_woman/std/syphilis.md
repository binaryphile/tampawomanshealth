What Is It?

: An infection caused by bacteria.

How Can I Get It?

: Sexual contact (vaginal, oral or anal) with someone who has syphilis.

What Are the Symptoms?

: **Early Stage**:  Painless sore on the mouth, vagina, anus or
elsewhere on the body.  Without treatment the sore will go away in a
couple of weeks but syphilis is still present in the body (many people
with syphilis do not notice the sores).

How Can I Know For Sure?

: Sores are examined by your doctor, or a blood test can be ordered for
syphilis.

How Is It Treated?

: Antibiotics or hospitalization may be necessary.

What Can Happen If I Don't Take Care Of It?

: **Second Stage**:  (6 weeks - 4 months after contact) new sores, rash,
fever, hair loss, body aches, sore throat or swollen glands.

: **Third Stage**:  (years later) damage to heart and/or brain, a
pregnant woman with syphilis can pass it onto the fetus, causing severe
damage or death and can cause severe infection of the reproductive
orgams (PID).
