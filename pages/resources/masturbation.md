Positive (healthy) sexuality is an important factor in one's mental and
physical health and is the key to maintaining a healthy and romantic
relationship. Developing positive sexual attitudes can take time. Here
are the elements of a positive sexual attitude:

1. Respect - Respect yourself and others at all times.
2. Safety - Protect yourself and your partner(s) from disease, unwanted
   pregnancy and negative emotional effects of sexual behavior.
3. Knowledge - Learn about the human body and mind, sexuality, health,
   reproduction and laws that effect sexuality.
4. Communication - Become comfortable talking about sexuality with other
   people. Become able to have mature discussions with your family,
   friends and especially your partner(s).

Masturbation is not harmful to a woman's reproductive system.
Masturbation is not necessary to achieve sexual satisfaction. Each woman
must arrive at her own definition of what she is comfortable with.

Masturbation can foster positive attitudes toward sexuality. The first
ingredient of a positive sexual attitude is knowledge of, and comfort
with one’s own body and sexuality. Masturbation can be a constructive
way to achieve these things.

For most people, sexuality begins with masturbation. Evidence has shown
that most people in the world masturbate. People masturbate as early as
infancy and as late as adulthood. Masturbation is healthy. It is safe.
It won’t cause hairy palms or acne and it won’t cause AIDS or other
sexually transmitted diseases. It can help you in numerous ways. It is a
healthy, positive way to release sexual tension. It teaches you about
your body and your physical and emotional responses to sexual
stimulation.

Becoming comfortable with masturbation, your body and your sexuality are
the first steps toward a healthy, fulfilling sexual life
