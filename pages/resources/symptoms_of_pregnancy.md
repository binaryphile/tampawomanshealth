Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman.  Each pregnancy may be
similar to, or very different from, a woman's last pregnancy.  One of
the most frequent symptoms of pregnancy is a missed period.
Understanding the symptoms of pregnancy should help us as women be able
to identify a new pregnancy, and begin to take appropriate action.
Whether a woman is deciding to terminate a pregnancy or carry to term,
identifying the pregnancy early is helpful.  Some women experience
symptoms of pregnancy as early as a week after conception.  Some women
may experience no symptoms other than their missed period.  Sometimes a
woman may be pregnant and does not miss her period early in the
pregnancy, or may not have kept track of the date of her last normal
menstrual cycle.

**If you have been sexually active and are experiencing any of the
following symptoms, it is important that you take a pregnancy test.**

Implantation Bleeding

: Implantation Bleeding can be one of the earliest signs of pregnancy.
When the embryo implants itself in the uterine wall (6-12 days after
conception), a woman may experience spotting and/or mild cramping.

Delayed or Missed Period

: Most woman do not have a period once they become pregnant, or if they
do, the period will be "different" in some way.  Perhaps it will be
lighter or much shorter.  A change in what you normally experience could
be a sign of pregnancy.

: It is possible that this is not due to a pregnancy, but rather could
be due to a change in birth control, an infection, or an abrasion from
intercourse.

Tender or Swollen Breasts

: Women may notice a change in their breasts.  Breasts may become
swollen or tender as early as 1 week after conception.  For some women,
this symptom of pregnancy does not present itself until some weeks
later.  Some women experience this due to hormonal imbalance, PMS or as
a reaction to birth control pills.

Morning Sickness/Nausea

: Some women experience morning sickness as early as 1-2 weeks after
conception.  Some women are not bothered by this symptom at all.  Some
women experience nausea only during the first trimester of pregnancy,
and some, throughout the entire pregnancy.

Frequent Urination

: Some women feel an increase in the frequency of urination due to
pregnancy.  This usually occurs 6-8 weeks into the first trimester.  It
may also be caused by an infection, diabetes, increased fluid intake or
by taking diuretics.

Food Cravings

: Sometimes women experience strong cravings for specific foods for part
or all of their pregnancy.  For some, it may indeed be unusual
combinations like the age old pickles and ice cream.  It may be for one
specific food or for a particular type of food.
