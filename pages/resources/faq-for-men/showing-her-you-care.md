1. Let her know you are sorry she is the one going through all of this
   physically.
2. Check in with her often about how she is feeling.
3. Do something special for her such as a card, flowers, a love letter,
   a back rub.
4. Be affectionate, but be prepared for her not to want to be sexual.
   You may feel rejected, but remember that she connects sex with this
   difficult situation.
5. Be understanding about pregnancy symptoms. Nausea, tiredness,
   irritability, and moodiness are all pregnancy symptoms. Most will go
   away within a few days after an abortion. If she continues the
   pregnancy, some symptoms like nausea may go away after 12 weeks or
   so.
6. If she chooses abortion, you can read over the aftercare instructions
   she is given. Have pain medications available and maybe a heating pad
   or hot water bottle. Help her avoid infection by not having
   intercourse for 2 weeks. If she is choosing to continue the
   pregnancy, you can attend prenatal visits and birthing classes with
   her.
7. Help with birth control. Use condoms. Help pay for the other birth
   control options. Practice safe sex.

Talking to someone
------------------

She may want to talk professionally if she is not handling the whole
thing well. It may help for you to talk to someone too. She may not be
the only one having a hard time. Ask your doctor of clinic if there is
someone you can speak to. Or, seek out counseling from a mental health
clinic, a family planning clinic or a private therapist. Sometimes
talking to a clergyperson is what you may be looking for. Many books and
websites in the resource section are especially for men. If you continue
to have a hard time with your partnerâ€™s decision, get help.
