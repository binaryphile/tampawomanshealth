title: Frequency of Urination During Pregnancy

When you are pregnant you may notice that you need to get up to pee more
often, during the night in particular. That’s because when you lie
down, some of the fluid that you retain in your legs and feet during the
day makes its way back into your bloodstream and eventually into your
bladder.

Some pregnancy books say that you’ll begin to feel some relief early in
your second trimester as your uterus rises out of your pelvis, but
research doesn’t support this idea. The fact is, you may not get the
fabled second trimester break at all.

In one study in which pregnant women actually measured how often and how
much they urinated, researchers found that both the frequency and volume
increased over the course of the women’s pregnancies, with no relief in
the second trimester.

During pregnancy, the uterus is growing and begins to press on the
woman’s bladder, causing the need for her to urinate more frequently.
Further, the increased volume of body fluids and the improved efficiency
of the kidneys help to rid the body more quickly of waste products. The
pressure on your bladder is often relieved once the uterus rises into
the abdominal cavity around the fourth month and does not return until
the third trimester when the baby "drops" back down into the pelvis in
the ninth month. By leaning forward when you urinate, you will ensure
that you empty your bladder completely and reduce trips to the bathroom.

It is important to remember that if you notice pain, burning, pus or
blood in your urine to see your health care provider right away. You
might have a urinary tract infection that needs treatment.
