Abortion Was Legal
==================

Abortion has been performed for thousands of years and in every society
that has been studied.  It was legal in the United States from the time
the earliest settlers arrived.  At the time the Constitution was
adopted, abortions before "quickening" were openly advertised and
commonly performed.
