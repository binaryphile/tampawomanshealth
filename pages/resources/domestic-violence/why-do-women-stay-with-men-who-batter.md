title: Why do Women Stay with Men who Batter?
---

Many battered women remain in a destructive and dangerous relationship
because:

- They **lack self-confidence**, or have low self esteem.
- Some women **feel ashamed** of having been beaten, and don’t want to
  admit it.
- She is "**standing by her man**" and feels that loyalty trumps safety.
- Some women **believe that the man will change**.
- Women often **worry that they cannot support themselves** and their
  children.
- Many women **accept a man’s apologies and promises** that it will
  never happen again.
- Often women are made to **believe that they somehow deserved, or
  caused** the violence.
- **Eventually a woman gets worn down, feel powerless and helpless.**

Sometimes emotional can hurt as much as physical violence. In some cases
emotional abuse involves name calling, or accusations, screaming at you,
it can also involve controlling your money or actions. Some women are
not allowed to work, or go out with their friends.  Sometimes women are
made to believe that their partner will take the children away. All of
these behaviors are considered emotional abuse.
