Morning sickness (can occur anytime of day) usually starts early in the
pregnancy.  It can be a miserable debilitating symptom of pregnancy.
This symptom usually disappears after the third month of pregnancy.

Suggestions

: - Eat as soon as you wake up.  Eating crackers or something very bland
  before you even get out of bed may help.
- Eat more small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals.
- Ginger candy or tea may help.  Ginger ale is also helpful.
- A spoonful of coke syrup may help.  This is sold over the counter at
  your drug store.
- Drink non-alcoholic beverages to keep hydrated, especially if you have
  been vomitting.
- Some women report success with acupuncture and hypnosis.

See your doctor if:

- You have very little urine, or if it is dark in color
- If the vomiting is so severe that you lose weight or become dehydrated
- If you vomit blood
- If you have a pounding or racing heart

If morning sickness is severe, consult your doctor.  It is important to
be nourished and hydrated, as well as comfortable.

Many patients report an almost immediate decrease in morning sickness
once their termination of pregnancy is complete.

Your doctor may prescribe anti-nausea medicine or IV fluids if you need
it.
