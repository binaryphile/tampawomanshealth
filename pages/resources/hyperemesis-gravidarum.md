Hyperemesis Gravidarum is extreme, ongoing nausea and vomiting during
pregnancy that can lead to dehydration and /or weight loss. This
condition is much more severe than “morning sickness”.

Symptoms Include:

- Severe nausea that lasts beyond the first three months of pregnancy.
- Severe, persistent nausea accompanied by vomiting.
- Inability to keep fluids down.
- Lightheadedness or fainting spells.
- Blood visible in vomit.
- Very dark colored urine.
- Heart racing or pounding.

This condition is serious because it may cause you to lose weight, or
become severely dehydrated. When you are dehydrated your body does not
have enough water. This can lead to very low blood pressure, and loss of
consciousness. This condition may require that you be treated with IV
fluids in the hospital. Your doctor may also prescribe other medications
and vitamins. Some anti-nausea medications may be helpful in severe
cases.

Be sure to pay attention to the length and severity of morning sickness.
If you feel that the symptoms are extremely severe, you should consult
with your doctor.

Your body goes through many changes during pregnancy. Morning sickness
is bothersome and often quite miserable. It does not always occur in the
morning. Some women experience it off and on at a variety of time
throughout the day or night. Regular morning sickness can be managed
with smaller meals, plenty of fluids, a change of diet and anti-nausea
medication. Hyperemesis is a more serious problem. If you suspect that
your morning sickness is very severe, you should consult your healthcare
provider.
