If you are post-menopausal of younger than 11 and bleeding you should
consult your physician immediately. Also do so if you are experiencing
virginal bleeding between periods. Try to determine where the bleeding
is coming from: Are you sure you are bleeding from your vagina? Or is it
the rectum? Is there blood in your urine?

What Causes Bleeding Between Periods?

Although the cause of irregular bleeding can vary according to
individual health situations, some of the more common causes include:
