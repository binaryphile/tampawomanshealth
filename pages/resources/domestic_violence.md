title: Domestic Violence
---

When your boyfriend or spouse gets angry does he:

- Threaten you?
- Hurt you physically?
- Make you have sex against your will?
- Isolate you from friends and family?
- Verbally berate or abuse you?
- Sometimes make you feel worthless and powerless?

If your answer to any of these questions is yes, you may be the victim
of "battering". **Battering is a form of domestic violence in a
relationship.** This type of relationship involves one partner, usually
the male, trying to control the other through fear and intimidation.

What starts as yelling, verbally disrespect and threats, often escalates
into physical violence. If any of these behaviors have been directed at
you, you should be alert to its cause and the effect on you and the
quality of your life.

If it has happened more than once, you are a battered woman and need to
seek help. You are not alone.

Men batter women because they believe they believe they have the right
to control a woman. Many men batter because they grew up in a violent
home, were themselves abused or mistreated, or witnessed domestic
violence growing up. These men are not necessarily mentally ill, but
they have learned that by threatening, frightening and abusing their
partners, they can get their way. You are not responsible for making him
"mad". He batters you for control, but the man usually makes his
battered partner believe that if she would act different, or...whatever,
that he would not be forced to physically and emotionally abuse her.
**You need to know that it is not your fault.** It is his learned
behavior that is bad and he is choosing to be violent to meet his own
needs.

Battering men tend to be extremely jealous and possessive. They often
keep their partners from making friends, or keeping in close touch with
their family. This type of behavior should be a warning sign. Batterers
often have low self esteem. After a violent event they may promise to
never do it again, or blame it on drugs or alcohol, or even on some
innocent action on your part. Often they blame "stress" that set them
off. Sometimes these men hold very strict beliefs about the roles of men
and women in relationships.

If you are battered, you will, over time learn to doubt yourself. You
will be taught that you deserve it, that you are worthless, and that it
is somehow all your fault. **Don't believe it.** If it has happened
once, it will happen again.
