Paternity testing can be done during the pregnancy to determine
paternity. A procedure called Amniocentesis done on the mother, will
report the fetal DNA. Amniocentesis can be done after a specific point
in the developing pregnancy.

A blood test or oral swab is also needed from the mother and the alleged
father to establish paternity. These tests can be done by a local
laboratory or by some services through a mail in specimen kit.

It takes about a week to receive the results. The lab will send the
results directly to you.

Difficult questions often arise during pregnancy. DNA testing may be
important to you, whether to give you peace of mind, or to provide you
with critical information related to child support and visitation.

Confidentiality is an important part of DNA testing. A number is
assigned to each case. Some companies assign a Case Manager to work
directly with you through the entire process. Without the assigned case
number no one can get the results of DNA testing. DNA testing is 99.9%
accurate.

DNA testing can be done on specimens that do not include blood or oral
swabs. Because DNA is in every cell in our bodies, even some "unusual
specimens" can provide the necessary information. Examples of theses
specimens can be hair follicles, clothing with blood or semen stains,
fingernail clippings, cigarette butts, toothbrushes, razor shavings,
bones, teeth, chewed gum and many other samples.

Contact any provider to discuss fee, requirements and services offered.
Some DNA testing services are accredited. Be sure to choose an
accredited lab. Results from such a lab are routinely 10 to 10,000 times
more accurate than what the courts require by law. The most respected
labs are accepted by:

- AABB (The American Association of Blood Banks)
- CAC  (College of American Pathologists)
- ACLASS  (ACLASS Accreditation Services for International laboratory
  Quality Standards )
- ASCLD/Lab International the American Society of Crime laboratory
