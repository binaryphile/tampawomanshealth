Do Male Birth Control Pills Really Exist?
=========================================
 
**No**, there is **no male birth control pill**. So far, medical science
has no safe, male birth control pill developed. Testosterone when taken
orally can decrease the natural production of the hormone in the body.
Generally because the message the body gets is that there is enough
testosterone aboard. This slows down or halts sperm production. There
are theories that suggest that this could lead to the development of the
male contraceptive pill. However, their effectiveness and safety have
not been tested or fully approved.
 
Some testosterone supplements are available in gel, or by injection, but
only as supplements, not birth control. These supplements are typically
to enhance male sex drive and erections.
 
Testosterone pills available outside the US have not been approved as
there is a strong evidence of long term damage to the liver.
