Some women experience **mild breast tenderness** just prior to their
period.  This tenderness may have to do with the **changing hormones in
your body**.  Some doctors speculate that it may be due to excess female
hormones - too much estrogen, progesterone or prolactin.  An imbalance
in these hormones may also cause breast tenderness.  The monthly change
in hormones can cause **fluid retention**, which may also contribute to
breast tenderness.  This type of tenderness usually goes away once your
period starts, or certainly by the time your period is over for the
month.

Breast tenderness **may also be an early sign of pregnancy**.  Usually
experienced beginning 6-8 weeks from conception.

Breast tenderness may also increase in the decade before menopause.
During this period of time, a woman's hormones are in flux.

Discomfort may increase with stress and a lack of exercise.

Relief
------

- Exercise, go for a walk, jog, work out.
- Give your breasts good support.  Wear a good bra.  Pad your bra with
  lamb's wool to protect the nipples from sending pain signals to your
  brain.
- Take an over the counter anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen
- Use ice packs.  Many women report 10-15 minutes with a damp washcloth
  filled with ice or a bag of frozen vegetables covered in a damp cloth
  gives them relief.
- Lower fat diet.  Research shows that a low fat diet reduces estrogen
  levels in the body.
- Decrease caffeine consumption.
- Eat less chocolate.  Chocolate and caffeine contain methylxanthine
  which may increase breast tenderness.
- Reduce salt intake.
