Normal menstrual bleeding lasts from 3 - 5 days. While it occurs on the
average of every 28 days, anywhere from 21 - 35 days between periods is
considered normal. For some women, their period is accompanied by
cramps. Some women experience cramps with their cycle some months and
other months have none at all. Some individuals always have very heavy
periods while others bleed very lightly.  There is no "one size fits
all" description of every woman's menstrual bleeding.

For most women, keeping a calendar of your period is helpful, both to
know clearly when your last cycle started and stopped and to have a
record of any unusual bleeding that may occur.

Bleeding or spotting between periods can be a frightening experience.
Usually there is no serious problem, but you should consult with your
doctor or nurse practitioner if you are concerned. There are many causes
of irregular bleeding, some causes are:

- Pregnancy Implantation
- Miscarriage
- Hormonal Fluctuations
- Starting, stopping or missing oral contraceptives
- Low thyroid levels
- Stress
- IUDâ€™s occasionally cause bleeding
- Injury to the vagina
- Malignant Cancers
- Undiagnosed vaginal infections
- Anticoagulants
- Vaginal dryness
- Ovulation

If you are post-menopausal or younger than 11 and bleeding, you should
consult with your doctor. If you experience breakthrough bleeding
between periods, it can be helpful to keep a log of how much and how
often. This information may be helpful when discussing this bleeding
with your healthcare provider.

Occasionally a woman may miss a period all together. This may indicate
pregnancy. There are other causes. Medications may cause you to bleed
irregularly, or may cause you to have your period early, late or not at
all. Stress can also be a factor that influences your period. Changing
birth control may also effect your period temporarily. We see this in
some women who start with Depo Prevera injections.

Each woman's body is unique. If you experience unusual bleeding,
spotting, or miss a period, there is probably nothing to worry about,
but we encourage you to consult with your healthcare provider if you are
concerned.
