Medications and Oral Contraceptives
===================================

Some medications cause the enzymes in your liver to more quickly break
down the estrogen supplied by your birth control pills. This makes the
oral contraceptive less effective.

Some examples of medications that may affect birth control are:

- Rifampin - used to treat tuberculosis
- Ampilcillian and Doxycycline - broad spectrum antibiotics
- Phenobarbital and Carbamazepine - anti-seizure medications
- Topiramate - used to treat migraines
- Grisefulvin - anti-fungal
- Herbal Preparations

Many health care providers recommend using a second method of birth
control the entire time a woman is taking any antibiotics or any of the
family of medications listed above, and for a full 7 days after the
antibiotics is stopped.

Remember, for oral contraceptives to be effective:

- Take them at the same time each day.
- Avoid smoking to prevent complications
- Use a back up method for 7 days, anytime you miss a pill or are taking
  other meds.
- Store oral contraceptives away from excessive heat and moisture.
