Surgical Termination 2nd Trimester - 14-24 Weeks LMP
====================================================

For patients 17-22 weeks LMP, it will take approximately two days to
complete the abortion.  The first step in the abortion is the insertion
of sterile laminaria, which are small, slim sticks of natural fiber
(seaweed).  Laminaria gradually swell over a period of several hours to
help stretch the opening of the uterus.  This helps to make the abortion
quicker, safer, and less painful.  You will be in the clinic four to
eight hours and will return home that evening.  The clinic should
provide a prescription for pain medication that must be filled as soon
as possible after leaving the office.  We highly recommend you have
adult companion with you.

The following day, you return for the removal of the laminaria and the
abortion procedure.  The procedure used is vacuum aspiration.  You will
spend approximately four to eight hours at the clinic and must be
accompanied by someone to drive you home.  Minors must make
parent/guardian aware of this procedure.  The parent/guardian does not
need to be present at the time of the procedure, however, the clinic
must be able to contact the parent/guardian in case of an emergency.
The parent/guardian must be with you overnight.
