Emergency Contraception - The Morning After Pill - Plan B
=========================================================

Emergency contraception is available in each of our centers Monday
through Saturday.

You will need to come into the clinic and bring with you a photo ID.
You will be asked to provide a urine sample so that we can determine
that you are not at this time already pregnant.

The doctor will review your medical history.

If Plan B is appropriate for you, you will take oral medication in the
clinic, followed 12 hours later by a second dose of medication at home.
