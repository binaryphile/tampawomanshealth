The least invasive procedure we offer are the Medical Abortions
(Methotrexate shot and RU486 pill) for pregnancies.  These early
procedures consist of a combination of drugs that will terminate and
expel the pregnancy when used in conjunction with each other.  This
option requires an average of three office visits, as well as the
commitment of the patient to chart the progress and results.  This
procedure is not right for everyone.  The final decision will be made by
our physician, based on the patient's medical history and a physical.
