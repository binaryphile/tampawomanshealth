The IV sedation we use is designed to make you feel drifty and dreamy
during the abortion.  It is very strong, but short acting.  Most
patients report no recall of the procedure after it is over.  This is
due to the type of sedation used in our clinics.

Because your safety is of the utmost importance, it is imperative that
you **do NOT eat or drink anything** at least 3 hours prior to your
arrival.

Sedation during the procedure is optional.  Some women choose to have
their abortion without sedation.  Feel free to ask one of our staff
members about the risks and benefits of the sedation when you schedule
your appointment, or upon your arrival at our facility.
