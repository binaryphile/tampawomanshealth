Abortion can be an emotional as well as a medical decision.  Often,
there are confused feelings surrounding an unplanned pregnancy.  Our
staff is committed to quality care and providing support through this
emotional time.

Our Clinics follow the National Abortion Federation (N.A.F.) "Standard
of Care".
